<p>Staticman is an open-source project made possible by <a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/graphs/contributors" class="cta">these volunteers</a>. In addition to the codebase that is available for anyone to run on their own infrastructure, we keep a free, public instance of the Staticman API for anyone to use.</p>

<p>This instance is donated by our sponsors, <a href="https://snipcart.com/" class="cta">Snipcart</a>. They kindly help us keep the lights on, but do not control in any way the roadmap of the project, nor does Staticman have any form of hidden commercial agenda, like including tracking scripts or selling data to anyone. We're good people and so are our sponsors.</p>
